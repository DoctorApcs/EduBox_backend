## Getting Started
To install this application, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIVIETNAMResearch/AIO_Research_Agent.git
cd AIO_Research_Agent
```

**2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
- For Unix/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
This project uses research papers from arXiv to search for relevant publications based on your topics of interest. 

### Option 1: Download Pre-extracted Embeddings
For a quick start, download pre-extracted embeddings for chromaDB from Hugging Face in this [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BachNgoH/ArxivDB_base/tree/main) and place them in the `./DB` folder. This dataset contains embeddings of the abstracts of approximately 330,000 arXiv papers in the fields of AI, ML, and DS, created using the `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` model/.

### Option 2: Self-Ingest Data
If you prefer to ingest your own data, you can use the Kaggle arXiv dataset.

**1. Download Data:** Obtain the arXiv dataset from Kaggle and store it in the `./data` folder.

**2. Ingest Paper Data:**

```bash
python src/paper_ingest.py
```


**Starting the Application**

Before starting your application, you need to fill in some evironment variables. Create a `.env` file and fill in these:

```bash
# LLM Provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY= # (Optional)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=

# For Searching
SERPER_API_KEY=

# Email Sending
SENDGRID_API_KEY= # (Optional)
CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET=

```
You can create th `CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET` by running the command `chainlit create-secret`.

Once everything is ready, you can launch the application by running:

```bash
chainlit run chainlit_app.py
```
The default username and password are `admin` and `admin`. Proper authentication will be added in the future.

### Daily Paper Update (In Progress)
This feature is currently under development. Upon completion, the application will automatically download and process new papers daily. The embeddings of these new papers will be extracted, and a summary of the day's updates will be compiled into a daily report.

These reports will be published in a separate repository: https://github.com/BachNgoH/DailyAIReports.git. You can clone this repository and place it in the outputs directory if you'd like your chatbot to interact with the daily reports:

```bash
mkdir outputs
cd outputs
git clone https://github.com/BachNgoH/DailyAIReports.git
```


## Acknowldgement

AIO Research Agent is made possible by these key technologies:

- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/): Providing the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework.
- [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/get-started/overview): Enabling the intuitive user interface.
